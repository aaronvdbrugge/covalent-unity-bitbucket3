There was a lot of rendundancy in these animations when I got them, so I boiled them down to save space.

Any "card back" frames are the same for all of them, and I just get them from _balloon.

I cropped all but balloon with a Photoshop action to reduce time spend slicing sprite sheets.
I left the top parts in to keep frame indices consistent.

Any frames that only have translation in them, I just remove... instead I do the translation in
Unity's animation tool.

There are actually only two animations, flip up and flip down. Rather than make 34 different
animation clips and Animator states, I just wrote a script called CardImageSwapper.cs that
seeks out swappable frames with "balloon" in them, and trades them for new ones in LateUpdate.
The script is general purpose, not necessarily specific to cards, and could be used again
for similar situations in the future.
