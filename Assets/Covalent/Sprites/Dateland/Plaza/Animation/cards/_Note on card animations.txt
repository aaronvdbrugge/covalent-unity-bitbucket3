There was a lot of rendundancy in these animations when I got them, so I boiled them down to save space.

Any "card back" frames are the same for all of them, and I just get them from _balloon.

Any frames that only have translation in them, I just remove... instead I do the translation in Unity's animation tool. The new animations are store in the "optimized" folder.
